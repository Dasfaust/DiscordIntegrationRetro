# DiscordIntegrationRetro

This mod is a WIP 1.7.10 port of [DiscordIntegration-Forge](https://github.com/ErdbeerbaerLP/DiscordIntegration-Forge). It currently integrates chat, join/leave, advancement, death, and server startup/shutdown messages. It also supports account linking and DiscordIntegration's whitelist system. More documentation will come at a further date!
